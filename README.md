# Pet Adoption App - Flutter

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a system for managing pet adoptions. The application will serve as a platform where pets like dogs, cats, and other fur babies are posted to look for new owners. The end-users of the application will create an account in the app and browse for pets they want to adopt. They can process the adoption electronically which is more convenient and efficient. 

By this version, features include:
- List of Pets: this module will show a list of pets that are available for adoption. In this module, categories of pets will be shown wherein those who want to adopt can browse.
- Pet Description: this module will display the details about a certain pet for adoption. The module will display the name, sex, color, age and other necessary information of the pet.
- Account Settings: this module will allow the user to customize his/her account in the app such as the appearance, the adoptions, favorites and privacy of the account.
